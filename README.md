# BMI Calculator

I created this to become more familiar with floats and rounding numbers.
I've updated this bmi calculator to become more familiar with else / if and elif statements

To use this you can open up the file in vs code and run using the play button at the top right of the code; then make your inputs using the terminal at the bottom of the screen!

Simply enter your height(m) and weight(kg) and it'll return your BMI index number like shown below!

This was coded using python!
